### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominic. I mainly write Python and develop release and deployment pipelines in non-standard environments as a software engineer. I really love exploring new languages and seeing what's "behind the curtain" (hint: it's almost always just more code that ends up as machine code on a processor). In the past I've explored Zig and Rust. I love how Zig removes the need for macros through comptime. At the moment I am exploring game development and operating system internals.

I have a blog that I ocassionally post on at www.thoughtsnotes.com. It is intentionally not flashy.
