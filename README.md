### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominic. I've mainly been working with Python for the past couple of years. I'm a software engineer working on public sector projects. I really love exploring new languages. At the moment I'm exploring Zig and Elixir. I love how Zig brings macros into the language through comptime and I'm really excited by Elixir's Erlang roots. I'm also intrigued by htmx.

I have a blog that I ocassionally post on at www.thoughtsnotes.com. It is intentionally not flashy.
