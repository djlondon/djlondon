### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dominic. I'm a software engineer working on public sector projects, mainly with Python. I really love exploring new languages. At the moment I'm exploring Zig and Elixir. I love how Zig removes the need for macros through comptime and I'm really excited by Elixir's Erlang roots. I'm also intrigued by htmx.

I have a blog that I ocassionally post on at www.thoughtsnotes.com. It is intentionally not flashy.
